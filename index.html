				  <p>Hi there, I’m Caroline. I’m a Graphic Designer within the Twin Cities area. In May 2020, I graduated with a BA in Graphic Design.  Throughout my coursework I focused on areas such as brand identity, web design, and UX/UI. Outside of my major classes I focused on areas such as communications, marketing, and photography. To further my education, I enrolled in a UX/UI certification program at the University of Minnesota.</p> 

					<p>Currently, I am trying to start a side business of creating wedding save the dates and wedding invites. In the future I would love to start a small business doing invites and floral design. Please check out my “wedding” page if you are interested in learning more.</p>
					
					<p>Please contact me at <i>blackfordcarolinemary@gmail.com</i> with any of your design needs, or reach out to have a coffee with me.</p>
